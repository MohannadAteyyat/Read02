# Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide
* In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.
## Version Control 
* Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.
### Local Version Control
* This basically means that Git is a content tracker.
### Centralized Version Control
* So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened.
### Distributed Version Control 
*  This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. 
## what is Git?
* Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
### Snapshots 
* Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
### Local Operations 
* Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.
### Tracking Changes 
* Change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
### Loss of Data 
* Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files.
### States
* Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
## History of Git
* Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.
